# GML for Atom

Enable GML syntax highlighting to your .gml files to use Atom as an external editor.

This is my first package and it is based on another so you might find some inconsistencies. Any recommendation is welcome.

I hope this package can help many other devs like me that want to take advantage of a serious code editor instead of the included with GM:S.
